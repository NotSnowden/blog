# Blog
My blog, aka the place where I document my experiments as a newbie sysadmin and other stuff \
Maybe one day I'll make it more dynamic, but right now it's not in my plans to throw js junk of any kind in it \
Error pages are from [here](https://github.com/denysvitali/nginx-error-pages). Right now only 404 and 403 are in use.
